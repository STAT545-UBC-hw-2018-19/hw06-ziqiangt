Introduction
------------

This is the first assignment of STAT 547M (despite it being named Homework 06).

First, let's load the used data

``` r
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(stringr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(testthat))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(stringi))
```

### 14.2.5 Exercises

#### Q1

In code that doesn’t use stringr, you’ll often see paste() and paste0(). What’s the difference between the two functions? Answer: paste() allows us to add an separator between strings while paste0() dose not. Here is an example:

``` r
paste("Task", "1", sep = "-")
```

    ## [1] "Task-1"

``` r
paste0("Task", "1")
```

    ## [1] "Task1"

What stringr function are they equivalent to? How do the functions differ in their handling of NA? Answer: paste() and paste0() equivalent to str\_c(). Here is an example:

``` r
str_c("Task", "1", sep = "-") 
```

    ## [1] "Task-1"

``` r
str_c("Task", "1", sep = "")
```

    ## [1] "Task1"

How do the functions differ in their handling of NA? Answer: NA is converted to a string "NA" in paste() and paste0(). However, if NA is one of the input strings for str\_c(), the output of str\_c() will be NA. Here is an example:

``` r
paste("Look ", NA, sep = "")
```

    ## [1] "Look NA"

``` r
paste0("Look ", NA)
```

    ## [1] "Look NA"

``` r
str_c("Look ", NA)
```

    ## [1] NA

#### Q2

In your own words, describe the difference between the sep and collapse arguments to str\_c(). Answer:"sep" is used to seperate a vector of strings and keep the vector format. While "collapse" to a vector of strings into a single string. Here is an example:

``` r
str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), c("a", "b", "c"), sep = ": ")
```

    ## [1] "x: a" "y: b" "z: c"

``` r
str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), c("a", "b", "c"), collapse = ":")
```

    ## [1] "xa:yb:zc"

#### Q3

Use str\_length() and str\_sub() to extract the middle character from a string. What will you do if the string has an even number of characters? Answer:First, we need to use str\_length to obtain the middle index. Then use str\_sub to output the middle character. Here is the example:

``` r
odd_string <- "eye"

# A function to find the middle index
find_middle <- function(input) {
  return(str_length(input) / 2 + 1)
}

# Obtain the middle index and output the midelle character
odd_index <- find_middle(odd_string) 
str_sub(odd_string, odd_index, odd_index)
```

    ## [1] "y"

What will you do if the string has an even number of characters? Answer: We need to modify the str\_sub. Because there are two middle characters now. Here is an modified example:

``` r
even_string <- "eyne"

# A function to find the middle index
find_middle_even <- function(input) {
  return(str_length(input) / 2 + 1 )
}

# Obtain the middle index and output the midelle character
even_index <- find_middle_even(even_string) 
str_sub(even_string, even_index-1, even_index)
```

    ## [1] "yn"

#### Q4

What does str\_wrap() do? When might you want to use it? Answer: str\_wrap() tries to implement the Knuth-Plass paragraph wrapping algorithm. It might be used when we need to sperate a long paragraph into multiple lines. Here is an example:

``` r
# a long sentence 
paragraph <- "One or more elements are missing or sketchy. Missed opportunities to complement code and numbers with a figure and interpretation. Technical problem that is relatively easy to fix. It’s hard to find the report in this crazy repo."

# view without wrap
cat(paragraph)
```

    ## One or more elements are missing or sketchy. Missed opportunities to complement code and numbers with a figure and interpretation. Technical problem that is relatively easy to fix. It’s hard to find the report in this crazy repo.

``` r
# view with wrap
cat(str_wrap(paragraph), sep = "\n")
```

    ## One or more elements are missing or sketchy. Missed opportunities to complement
    ## code and numbers with a figure and interpretation. Technical problem that is
    ## relatively easy to fix. It’s hard to find the report in this crazy repo.

#### Q5

What does str\_trim() do? Answer: str\_trim() removes whitespace from start and end of string.

``` r
# before removing whitespace from start and end of string
spaces_string = "  I am  "
spaces_string
```

    ## [1] "  I am  "

``` r
# After using str_trim() 
no_spaces_string <- str_trim(spaces_string)
no_spaces_string
```

    ## [1] "I am"

What’s the opposite of str\_trim()? Answer: The opposite is str\_pad() which is used to add whitespace. Here is an example to combine neighborhood character of letters.

``` r
letters %>%
  .[1:10] %>% 
  str_pad(width = 2, side = "right") %>%
  str_c(letters[2:11])
```

    ##  [1] "a b" "b c" "c d" "d e" "e f" "f g" "g h" "h i" "i j" "j k"

Write a function that turns (e.g.) a vector c("a", "b", "c") into the string a, b, and c. Think carefully about what it should do if given a vector of length 0, 1, or 2.

``` r
vector_to_string <- function(v) {
  if (length(v) == 0){
    return("")
  }
  else if (length(v) == 1){
    return(v)
  }
  else{
    front <- str_c(v[-length(v)], collapse = ", ")
    whole <- str_c(front, v[length(v)], sep = " and ")
    return(whole)
  }
}

#begin to test
vector_to_string(c(""))
```

    ## [1] ""

``` r
vector_to_string(c("a"))
```

    ## [1] "a"

``` r
vector_to_string(c("a", "b"))
```

    ## [1] "a and b"

``` r
vector_to_string(c("a", "b","c"))
```

    ## [1] "a, b and c"
