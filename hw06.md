## Introduction
This is the first assignment of STAT 547M (despite it being named Homework 06).

First, let's load the used data

```r
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(stringr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(testthat))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(stringi))
```

### 14.2.5 Exercises
####Q1
In code that doesn’t use stringr, you’ll often see paste() and paste0(). What’s the difference between the two functions? 
Answer: paste() allows us to add an separator between strings while paste0() dose not. Here is an example:

```r
paste("Task", "1", sep = "-")
```

```
## [1] "Task-1"
```

```r
paste0("Task", "1")
```

```
## [1] "Task1"
```

What stringr function are they equivalent to? How do the functions differ in their handling of NA?
Answer: paste() and paste0() equivalent to str_c(). Here is an example:

```r
str_c("Task", "1", sep = "-") 
```

```
## [1] "Task-1"
```

```r
str_c("Task", "1", sep = "")
```

```
## [1] "Task1"
```

How do the functions differ in their handling of NA?
Answer: NA is converted to a string "NA" in paste() and paste0(). However, if NA is one of the input strings for str_c(), the output of str_c() will be NA. Here is an example:

```r
paste("Look ", NA, sep = "")
```

```
## [1] "Look NA"
```

```r
paste0("Look ", NA)
```

```
## [1] "Look NA"
```

```r
str_c("Look ", NA)
```

```
## [1] NA
```

####Q2
In your own words, describe the difference between the sep and collapse arguments to str_c().
Answer:"sep" is used to seperate a vector of strings and keep the vector format. While "collapse" to a vector of strings into a single string. Here is an example:

```r
str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), c("a", "b", "c"), sep = ": ")
```

```
## [1] "x: a" "y: b" "z: c"
```

```r
str_c(c("x", "y", "z"), c("a", "b", "c"), collapse = ":")
```

```
## [1] "xa:yb:zc"
```

####Q3
Use str_length() and str_sub() to extract the middle character from a string. What will you do if the string has an even number of characters?
Answer:First, we need to use str_length to obtain the middle index. Then use str_sub to output the middle character. Here is the example:

```r
odd_string <- "eye"

# A function to find the middle index
find_middle <- function(input) {
  return(str_length(input) / 2 + 1)
}

# Obtain the middle index and output the midelle character
odd_index <- find_middle(odd_string) 
str_sub(odd_string, odd_index, odd_index)
```

```
## [1] "y"
```

What will you do if the string has an even number of characters?
Answer: We need to modify the str_sub. Because there are two middle characters now. Here is an modified example:

```r
even_string <- "eyne"

# A function to find the middle index
find_middle_even <- function(input) {
  return(str_length(input) / 2 + 1 )
}

# Obtain the middle index and output the midelle character
even_index <- find_middle_even(even_string) 
str_sub(even_string, even_index-1, even_index)
```

```
## [1] "yn"
```


####Q4
What does str_wrap() do? When might you want to use it?
Answer: str_wrap() tries to implement the Knuth-Plass paragraph wrapping algorithm. It might be used when we need to sperate a long paragraph into multiple lines. Here is an example:

```r
# a long sentence 
paragraph <- "One or more elements are missing or sketchy. Missed opportunities to complement code and numbers with a figure and interpretation. Technical problem that is relatively easy to fix. It’s hard to find the report in this crazy repo."

# view without wrap
cat(paragraph)
```

```
## One or more elements are missing or sketchy. Missed opportunities to complement code and numbers with a figure and interpretation. Technical problem that is relatively easy to fix. It’s hard to find the report in this crazy repo.
```

```r
# view with wrap
cat(str_wrap(paragraph), sep = "\n")
```

```
## One or more elements are missing or sketchy. Missed opportunities to complement
## code and numbers with a figure and interpretation. Technical problem that is
## relatively easy to fix. It’s hard to find the report in this crazy repo.
```

####Q5
What does str_trim() do? 
Answer: str_trim() removes whitespace from start and end of string. 

```r
# before removing whitespace from start and end of string
spaces_string = "  I am  "
spaces_string
```

```
## [1] "  I am  "
```

```r
# After using str_trim() 
no_spaces_string <- str_trim(spaces_string)
no_spaces_string
```

```
## [1] "I am"
```

What’s the opposite of str_trim()?
Answer: The opposite is str_pad() which is used to add whitespace. Here is an example to combine neighborhood character of letters.

```r
letters %>%
  .[1:10] %>% 
  str_pad(width = 2, side = "right") %>%
  str_c(letters[2:11])
```

```
##  [1] "a b" "b c" "c d" "d e" "e f" "f g" "g h" "h i" "i j" "j k"
```

Write a function that turns (e.g.) a vector c("a", "b", "c") into the string a, b, and c. Think carefully about what it should do if given a vector of length 0, 1, or 2.

```r
vector_to_string <- function(v) {
  if (length(v) == 0){
    return("")
  }
  else if (length(v) == 1){
    return(v)
  }
  else{
    front <- str_c(v[-length(v)], collapse = ", ")
    whole <- str_c(front, v[length(v)], sep = " and ")
    return(whole)
  }
}

#begin to test
vector_to_string(c(""))
```

```
## [1] ""
```

```r
vector_to_string(c("a"))
```

```
## [1] "a"
```

```r
vector_to_string(c("a", "b"))
```

```
## [1] "a and b"
```

```r
vector_to_string(c("a", "b","c"))
```

```
## [1] "a, b and c"
```

### 14.3.1.1 Exercises
#### Q1
Explain why each of these strings don’t match a \: "\", "\\", "\\\"?

symbol | Definition
----------------|------------------
   `\`      |  used as an escape character in regular expressions
   `\\`     | trated as a symbol "\"
   `\\\`    | a back slash + an escape character
   
Here is an example:

```r
test <- "I\\AM"

str_view(test, pattern = "\\\\", match = TRUE)
```

<!--html_preserve--><div id="htmlwidget-a309cb611018405edf79" style="width:960px;height:100%;" class="str_view html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-a309cb611018405edf79">{"x":{"html":"<ul>\n  <li>I<span class='match'>\\<\/span>AM<\/li>\n<\/ul>"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script><!--/html_preserve-->

####Q2
How would you match the sequence "'\?
Answer: Both ' and \ need to be escaped in regex.

```r
test <- "I'\\AM"

str_view(test, pattern = "\\'\\\\", match = TRUE)
```

<!--html_preserve--><div id="htmlwidget-d135e30839af8ea78765" style="width:960px;height:100%;" class="str_view html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-d135e30839af8ea78765">{"x":{"html":"<ul>\n  <li>I<span class='match'>'\\<\/span>AM<\/li>\n<\/ul>"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script><!--/html_preserve-->

####Q3
What patterns will the regular expression \..\..\.. match? How would you represent it as a string?
Answer: It match ".anycharacter.anycharacter.anycharacter"

```r
test <- "I.A.M.z...xxx"

str_view(test, pattern = "\\..\\..\\..", match = TRUE)
```

<!--html_preserve--><div id="htmlwidget-97e151edd44a5b556444" style="width:960px;height:100%;" class="str_view html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-97e151edd44a5b556444">{"x":{"html":"<ul>\n  <li>I<span class='match'>.A.M.z<\/span>...xxx<\/li>\n<\/ul>"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script><!--/html_preserve-->
